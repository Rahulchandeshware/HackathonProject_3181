# Tutorials Ninja - Automated Testing with Selenium, Java, and Cucumber

Welcome to the **Tutorials Ninja** GitHub repository! This project is a comprehensive automated testing solution for the **Tutorials Ninja** website. The testing framework uses **Selenium WebDriver**, **Java**, **Cucumber**, and **Page Object Model (POM)** to verify the key functionalities of the website.

The project was developed as part of a **Hackathon** initiative by a team of two collaborators, with the goal of automating the testing process and ensuring the website's features are working as expected. The test suite includes **76 test cases**, covering the major functionalities of the site.

## Project Overview

**Tutorials Ninja** is an e-learning platform that offers tutorials on various topics. The purpose of this project is to ensure the core features of the website are functioning properly by running automated tests. The project is built with Selenium and Cucumber to simulate user interactions and verify that the application behaves as expected.

This Hackathon project was split among two team members, with each collaborator contributing to different parts of the framework.

## Features

The automated tests cover the following features of the **Tutorials Ninja** website:

- **User Login**: Validates the login process for registered and unregistered users.
- **Search Functionality**: Ensures that the search bar works correctly.
- **Product Page**: Verifies the functionality of product details and navigation.
- **Cart Operations**: Tests adding and removing items from the cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Validates the checkout flow and order submission.
- **Profile Management**: Ensures users can update and manage their profiles.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium WebDriver**: Used for automating the web interactions.
- **Java**: The primary programming language for implementing test cases.
- **Cucumber**: A testing framework used to define behavior-driven test scenarios.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: A design pattern for creating object-oriented classes that serve as an interface to the web page's elements.
- **JUnit**: Used for managing and running tests.
- **Maven**: Used for project management and dependency resolution.

## Test Coverage

This project includes **76 test cases**, covering various aspects of the website's functionality. These test cases ensure that both the frontend and backend features are well-tested. The main functionalities such as login, search, checkout, and cart operations are all thoroughly validated.
